# Introduction

## IATI project location data collection and management approach

This section describes how project location data should be collected, including information on technical requirements and expected formats; this guidance is intended for data collectors' staff, i.e. donors, Project Executing Agencies (PEAs), consultants, and other external stakeholders responsible for data collection and management.

## What is a Project Location?

According to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) Standard, a project location is a set of geographical features and additional attributes that are part of a financially supported activity, where it is not feasible to make any further geographical distinctions with regards to funding. For instance, a financially supported hospital at specific site is an example of a single-feature project location. Another example of a multi-feature project location is a group of adjacent agricultural plots that are being financed under an irrigation plan that benefits all producers in that area. A set of protected areas that are jointly financed from a single source of funding is another example of a multi-feature project location. However, if funding allocation can be further distinguished by smaller geographic areas, data across multiple project locations and the respective financial allocations should be collected. We strongly encourage capturing the geographical discrimination of financial flows to specific project locations where possible, which contributes to transparency and financial accountability. 

In our data model, a location is always defined as the combination of a specific project activity with its respective geographic coordinates and additional project-specific, site-specific and activity-related attributes. Thus, additional attributes of a project location are project number, village name, location name, activity description, location type and geographical exactness, among others.

## The new proposed IATI project location model 

The IATI project location model is a structured data model, developed by [MAPME Community of Practice members](https://www.mapme-initiative.org/), to collect location-specific information about projects supported by international development cooperation. The model is in use and continues to be developed by them, together with their peers and partners. 

The model, in Excel format, is currently available for download in English and French, see also [Excel Templates](./annex1.md). The model can be used in combination with a Geojson file. 

Data related to specific project locations should be collected with respect to the outlined requirements. Please see FAQ for more information about the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standards and enhancements particular to [MAPME Community of Practice members'](https://www.mapme-initiative.org/) operational needs.
