Welcome to the [MAPME Community`s of Practice](https://www.mapme-initiative.org/) guide for collecting project location data in development cooperation. This website will describe how to collect and validate project locations according to the specifications of our data-model. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions for improvements, please open a ticket in our [Github repository](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/IATI-Project-Location-Standard).

## Goals
This guide: 
 - Describes the data model and its development (version control) and serves as an open-source reference for other institutions in the development cooperation sector
 - Shows International Aid and Development Cooperation partners how to submit geospatial information on project locations, based on the requirements of the present data model 
 - Enables partners and staff to validate submitted geo-information against the requirements of the data model


## Intended audiences
This guide is prepared for: 
 - **International Aid and Development Cooperation partners and stakeholders** i.e. the project-executing agency (PEA) or a consulting entity assisting the PEA alongside project development and implementation phases. We recommend our partners and stakeholders to identify staff with knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist with the data collection process.
 - **Data collection staff:** Responsible for the data collection, verification, and submission to other partners and stakeholders.
